# CMSC207miniproject

The purpose of this project is to put our recently acquired knowledge on HTML, CSS, and javascript to actual use.
This is also a way for us to introduce ourselves to our instructor.

Note on javascript functionality: Javascript was used to automatically switch the image in the "hobbies" section when the cursor is hovering on the div, and will switch back when the cursor is removed.
